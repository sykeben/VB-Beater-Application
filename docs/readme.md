# Visual Basic and .NET Beater Application
This is an application I use to test stuff in VB, .NET, and VB.NET

[Download the Latest Release](https://github.com/sykeben/VB-Beater-Application/releases/latest "Latest release on GitHub")

Just a simple application that I am making in VB, .NET, and VB.NET to test methods, styles, formatting, etc. I am trying to write regular releases so people can see how the code progresses and see my methods.
