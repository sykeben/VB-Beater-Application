# Visual Basic and .NET Beater Application
This is an application I use to test stuff in VB, .NET, and VB.NET

Just a simple application that I am making in VB, .NET, and VB.NET to test methods, styles, formatting, etc. I am trying to write regular releases so people can see how the code progresses and see my methods.
